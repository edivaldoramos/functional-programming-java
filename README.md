<h2>Functional programming with Java</h2>
<h3>About</h3>

This project has some demonstration examples of the use of functional Java interfaces.

- [Consumer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html) is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference. 
- [Function](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Function.html) is a functional interface that accepts one argument and produces a result.
- [Predicate](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html) is a functional interface that represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
- [Supplier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html) is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.

The complete documentation about functional interfaces in Java is available [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html).
